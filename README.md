Tired of all those notebooks, that are identical and one-dimensional? This notebook is two dimensional, so you can drag your todo-lists on your screen while they drag you around in real life!

Features:
- 2D, draggable notes
- Note content is in markdown, so you can have fun with that. (using the `marked` library)
- You can stack nodes inside each other! So you can have `my notebook / shopping list / jan 31`
- Somewhat clean user interface. At any rate, there aren't any useless toolbars.
